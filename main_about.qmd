# About Me

I’m a Ph.D. candidate in biostatistics at the University of Utah. I love turning complex data into clear stories that are informative and clearly tell actionable items.

I love digging into the "why" behind things—hence why I majored in math as an undergrad! By the time I graduated, thought, I was lost about what to do next. Long story short: a personal experience got me excited about transforming the paradigm of treatment. 

Imagine patients with a chronic illness facing several therapy options. Right now, the go-to is basically "try one, see if it works, then move on"—if one even does. That trial-and-error eats up so much time, energy, and money. And here’s the kicker: getting sick often drains your resources. Medical bills stack up, folks may need to cut back on work (or even lose their job), and paychecks shrink. Suddenly, the idea of hopping from treatment A to B to C feels downright impossible. And I didn't even mention about added burden from experiencing side-effects from treatments.

What if we flipped the script? Let’s generate truly personalized “recipes” (ingredients and amounts!) for each person up front, and then match them to the treatments most likely to work on day one.

Some existing research fields, such as causal inference and dynamic treatment regimes, get us close to this concept, but I don't think we are anywhere near achieving it. My Ph.D. education has exposed me to both, and I'm excited to continue working on many stats/math projects until I can achieve my goal of tailoring prescriptions to individuals as described above!

And about me outside of school: I don't have any extra time besides connecting with my family abroad, occasional catch-ups with my friends, Sunday church, and watching Korean shows. Okay, that's a pretty good list now that I look at it. Hahaha


# Research Interests

- **Precision Medicine**  
  This term is broad and encompasses any research aimed at tailoring treatments to subgroups or individuals who share common characteristics, with the goal of helping each person receive the most optimal treatment.
- **Causal Inference**
  Rather than the traditional associational study, I like doing things that can be more like "causal" in nature! 
- **Dynamic Treatment Regimes**  
  Identifying sequence of treatment choices that yields the best outcome of interest
