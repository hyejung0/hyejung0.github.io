I am a biostatistician with experience supporting collaborative clinical and translational research, particularly in oncology and chronic disease research. My work focuses on rigorous study design, reproducible statistical analysis in R, and clear communication of results to clinical collaborators.

**Current interests**

- Causal inference and individualized treatment decision-making for time-to-event outcomes  
- Bayesian and hierarchical modeling for clinical trial endpoints and surrogate outcomes  
- Application of Bayesian Nonparametric methods 
- High-performance / parallel computing workflows for scalable analyses in R
