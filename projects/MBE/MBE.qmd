# Introduction

Below is introduction used in our team's [nature medicine paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02418-0). 


>   Chronic kidney disease a common disease globally, and is associated with increased risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease and mortality. A critical challenge in the evaluation of therapies for CKD is that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) traditionally use kidney failure and doubling of serum creatinine as clinical endpoints, which are often late events in the progression of CKD2. To obtain sufficient clinical events to achieve adequate statistical power, RCTs often require substantial follow-up or are restricted to patients with rapidly progressive or late-stage disease, yet some interventions may have a greater effect when applied earlier in the disease course.


>   For all kidney diseases, patients must have a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to reach kidney failure, providing strong biological plausibility for GFR decline as a surrogate endpoint for CKD progression in RCTs. There is also robust epidemiological evidence that both a single measurement of GFR and GFR decline over 1–3-year periods are strongly associated with subsequent kidney failure across subgroups of age, sex and diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease status failure.


>   Using a smaller number of RCTs, we previously demonstrated that treatment effects on the GFR slope were highly predictive of treatment effects on clinical endpoints in hypothetical future RCTs. On the basis of this evidence, GFR slope has been used to evaluate efficacy of 
treatments in less common conditions, such as glomerular diseases, or when treatments with established efficacy and safety in one population are expanded to another population. However, there remains uncertainty as to the use of GFR slope in more common causes of kidney 
diseases and across severity of kidney disease, further limiting evaluation of new therapies in many kidney disease settings.


>   RCTs in populations with earlier stages of CKD or populations at risk for CKD evaluated the efficacy of novel agents for prevention of adverse outcomes, including mortality, heart failure events and CKD progression. These studies provide the opportunity to evaluate if the strong associations between treatment effects on GFR slope with those on the clinical endpoint persist with inclusion of more diverse interventions and populations. The expanded set of studies also allows a more robust assessment of consistency of results across disease. Together, these data have the potential to strengthen the evidence for the validity of GFR slope as a surrogate endpoint for kidney failure, providing support for its use as a primary endpoint for trials of CKD progression across a broad series of settings.





So far, our team has used a single surrogate endpoint to improve the precision of estimating treatment effects on various clinical endpoints of interest. There are several endpoints we’re interested in—all identified by our clinical team members—and each hold important meaning.

What I’ll be doing is:

1. Extending the approach to include more than one surrogate endpoint to further increase precision,
2. Improving the method to make it more statistically principled, and
3. Weighting each surrogate endpoint based on the time required to obtain its value.

We’re thrilled about the progress we’ve made so far. We can’t share our work just yet, but based on our results, it might really convince the FDA to consider using surrogates + Bayesian statistics to develop drugs for early-stage (or honestly, any stage) chronic kidney disease patients—because our method improves precision at all time points!
