    "title": "Impact of waiting for molecular test result about targetable mutation on the survival of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nLung cancer is most common form of cancer in U.S.1, and 5-year survival rate of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) is very low, estimated to be 9%2.\nThe recommended course of treatments are identified in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline. The guideline suggests each patient to perform biopsy to identify presence of targetable mutations of certain biomarkers and PDL1 expression to make a informed decision on first-line (1L) therapy choice. This recommendation is made because targeted therapy is better for patient’s survival than a standard, genetic therapy such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Usually, at least 1 positive mutation or 2 negative mutation status among all targetable biomarkers should be obtained to make informed decision about targetable therapy. Thus having at least 1 positive mutation or 2 negative mutation status will be referred to as useful mutation test result from here onward. Similarly, obtaining PDL1 expression level (from 0-100%) level, as opposed to result such as missing expression level or indeterminate result, will be referred to as useful PDL1 test result.\nThe standard NCCN guideline, however, may not always be followed due to reasons such as clinician’s expert knowledge and ethics. For example, heavy smokers who develop lung cancer is most likely due to smoking rather than genetic mutation. Patients who fall into this category then may receive chemotherapy right away, instead of performing and waiting for genetic or PDL1 test results. One reason for not waiting until the useful test comes out is that a complete panel of test results (combined mutation and PDL1 expression tests) usually takes about 2-3 weeks to become available. It may take longer if the biopsy samples were not good and the test results are indeterminate, requiring another round of biopsy and waiting for the result. This period of waiting without doing any treatment may be detrimental to patient’s health and thus becomes an ethical issue. Therefore, the ultimate choice of whether waiting for the test result or not relies heavily on the clinician’s decision.\nJust like the example of heavy smokers, there are some patient characteristics that are highly indicative of patient’s likelihood of targetable mutation status. However, there has not yet been a quantitative evaluation of effect of proceeding to 1L therapy prior to knowing targetable mutation status in patients. In this study, we evaluate causal effect of proceeding right 1L therapy in all aNSCLC patients, as well as in some subgroups that have previously been identified as associated with the mutation status.\n\n\nObjective\nPrimary Objective: Using marginal structural model, we will develop and evaluate the effect of proceeding to 1L therapy prior to obtaining useful targetable mutation status\n\nLimit the number of weeks.\nFor entire observation.\n\nSecondary Objective: Test impact of proceeding to 1L before useful tests become available in the following subgroups: male, female, have history of smoking, do not have history of smoking, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score 0-2, baseline ECOG score 3-4, baseline albumin &lt; 35g/L, baseline albumin &gt;= 35 g/L, and Asian.\n\nThese are the subgroups identified by Wally as having either higher or lower probability of having targetable mutation, and thus would more or less likely wait for the useful test results to become available prior to initiating 1L therapy.\n\nInitial assessment of the data and statistical analysis plan can be found here. Please note that this project is ongoing and is incomplete.\nBefore running the complicated marginal structural model, we decided to perform associational analysis with simpler methods, and the result can be found here. Please note that this project is ongoing and is incomplete.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Jemal, A. et al. Global cancer statistics. CA: a cancer journal for clinicians 61, 69–90 (2011).\n\n\n2.

    "title": "Improving precision of chronic kidney disease’s treatment effect on clinical endpoint by incorporating surrogate endpoints",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nBelow is introduction used in our team’s nature medicine paper.\n\nChronic kidney disease a common disease globally, and is associated with increased risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease and mortality. A critical challenge in the evaluation of therapies for CKD is that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) traditionally use kidney failure and doubling of serum creatinine as clinical endpoints, which are often late events in the progression of CKD2. To obtain sufficient clinical events to achieve adequate statistical power, RCTs often require substantial follow-up or are restricted to patients with rapidly progressive or late-stage disease, yet some interventions may have a greater effect when applied earlier in the disease course.\n\n\nFor all kidney diseases, patients must have a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to reach kidney failure, providing strong biological plausibility for GFR decline as a surrogate endpoint for CKD progression in RCTs. There is also robust epidemiological evidence that both a single measurement of GFR and GFR decline over 1–3-year periods are strongly associated with subsequent kidney failure across subgroups of age, sex and diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease status failure.\n\n\nUsing a smaller number of RCTs, we previously demonstrated that treatment effects on the GFR slope were highly predictive of treatment effects on clinical endpoints in hypothetical future RCTs. On the basis of this evidence, GFR slope has been used to evaluate efficacy of treatments in less common conditions, such as glomerular diseases, or when treatments with established efficacy and safety in one population are expanded to another population. However, there remains uncertainty as to the use of GFR slope in more common causes of kidney diseases and across severity of kidney disease, further limiting evaluation of new therapies in many kidney disease settings.\n\n\nRCTs in populations with earlier stages of CKD or populations at risk for CKD evaluated the efficacy of novel agents for prevention of adverse outcomes, including mortality, heart failure events and CKD progression. These studies provide the opportunity to evaluate if the strong associations between treatment effects on GFR slope with those on the clinical endpoint persist with inclusion of more diverse interventions and populations. The expanded set of studies also allows a more robust assessment of consistency of results across disease. Together, these data have the potential to strengthen the evidence for the validity of GFR slope as a surrogate endpoint for kidney failure, providing support for its use as a primary endpoint for trials of CKD progression across a broad series of settings.\n\nSo far, our team has used a single surrogate endpoint to improve the precision of estimating treatment effects on various clinical endpoints of interest. There are several endpoints we’re interested in—all identified by our clinical team members—and each hold important meaning.\nWhat I’ll be doing is:\n\nExtending the approach to include more than one surrogate endpoint to further increase precision,\nImproving the method to make it more statistically principled, and\nWeighting each surrogate endpoint based on the time required to obtain its value.\n\nWe’re thrilled about the progress we’ve made so far. We can’t share our work just yet, but based on our results, it might really convince the FDA to consider using surrogates + Bayesian statistics to develop drugs for early-stage (or honestly, any stage) chronic kidney disease patients—because our method improves precision at all time points!\nNote: Relevant code I am using for my project can still be found on my github, though my Github page is not setup to be self-explanatory at this point."

    "text": "About Me\nI’m a biostatistician at the Division of Epidemiology at the University of Utah. I love turning complex data into clear stories that are informative and clearly tell actionable items.\nI love digging into the “why” behind things—hence why I majored in math as an undergrad! By the time I graduated, thought, I was lost about what to do next. Long story short: a personal experience got me excited about transforming the paradigm of treatment.\nImagine patients with a chronic illness facing several therapy options. Right now, the go-to is basically “try one, see if it works, then move on”—if one even does. That trial-and-error eats up so much time, energy, and money. And here’s the kicker: getting sick often drains your resources. Medical bills stack up, folks may need to cut back on work (or even lose their job), and paychecks shrink. Suddenly, the idea of hopping from treatment A to B to C feels downright impossible. And I didn’t even mention about added burden from experiencing side-effects from treatments.\nWhat if we flipped the script? Let’s generate truly personalized “recipes” (ingredients and amounts!) for each person up front, and then match them to the treatments most likely to work on day one.\nSome existing research fields, such as causal inference and dynamic treatment regimes, get us close to this concept, but I don’t think we are anywhere near achieving it. My Ph.D. education has exposed me to both, and I’m excited to continue working on many stats/math projects until I can achieve my goal of tailoring prescriptions to individuals as described above!\nAnd about me outside of school: I don’t have any extra time besides connecting with my family abroad, occasional catch-ups with my friends, Sunday church, and watching Korean shows. Okay, that’s a pretty good list now that I look at it. Hahaha\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\nPrecision Medicine\nThis is an umbrella term that encompasses any research aimed at tailoring treatments to subgroups or individuals who share common characteristics, with the goal of helping each person receive the most optimal treatment.\nCausal Inference Rather than the traditional associational study, I like doing things that can be more like “causal” in nature!\nDynamic Treatment Regimes\nIdentifying sequence of treatment choices that yields the best outcome of interest\nBayesian Nonparametric\nJust started learning about this field. I like the method is more truly following the Bayesian philosophy, rather\n\n\n\nEducation\nUniversity of Utah | Salt Lake City, UT, U.S.A\nPhD in Population Health Sciences, Division of Biostatistics | 2020 - 2025\nBrigham Young University | Provo, UT, U.S.A\nM.S. in Statistics | 2018 - 2020\nUniversity of Calgary | Calgary, AB, Canada\nB.Sc. in Pure Mathematics with minor in Applied Mathematics | 2010 -2014\n\n\nExperience\nDivision of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah | Research Associate | 2025 - present\nHuntsman Cancer Institute | Graduate Research Assistant | Aug 2020 - 2025\nBiostatistics Intern | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals | May 2024 - Aug 2024\nBrigham Young University | Graduate Research Assistant | Aug 2018 - Aug 2020"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nBody compositions have been identified to be associated with survival of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients. Recent evidence suggests that body composition variables (e.g., skeletal muscle mass and fat mass) may serve as independent prognostic factors of overall survival in varying cancer types and stages, including metastatic lung cancer. Work from our group reveals a 63% (0.37 HR, 95%CI 0.16, 0.87) and 43% (0.57 HR, 95%CI 0.35, 0.93) reduction in mortality risk with greater muscle and fat mass, respectively, at time of mNSCLC diagnosis.\nThe purpose of the present investigation is to evaluate the relationship between longitudinal body compositions, as measured with the new CT scan software, at diagnosis and changes throughout treatment, and overall survival among mNSCLC patients.\nInitial assessment of the data and statistical analysis plan can be found here.\nThe result can be found here.\nInterestingly, some fat compositions increased in volume over time! This was a bit of an unexpected result, as we generally observe that mNSCLC patients tend to lose weight (fat + muscle) over time. We assumed that one year since diagnosis would be long enough to capture that trend, but maybe it wasn’t? We haven’t consulted with our oncologist yet about this finding.\nWe found some significant associations between body compositions and death. As expected, an increase in body composition was generally associated with a lower hazard of death. In particular, using total fat and body volume in the mid-section of the body showed a strong trend in that direction."
