    "text": "I’m a Ph.D. candidate in biostatistics at the University of Utah. I love turning complex data into clear stories that are informative and clearly tell actionable items.\nI love reasoning and understanding the “why” behind things—hence why I majored in math in my undergraduate studies! By the end of my bachelor’s, I was lost and unsure of what to do. Long story short, through personal experience, I became interested in changing the paradigm of treatment. Suppose a patient has a disease or illness and there are multiple treatment options available. Currently, patients are supposed to try each treatment until they find something that works for them (only if there is one that actually works for them; who knows, there may be none). This process requires so much time, energy, and money from the patients, and I thought it was very ineffective and unrealistic. Patients usually don’t have as many resources as healthy people. So, I thought we should flip that around: let’s find ways to generate prescriptions (“recipes”) tailored for a specific individual (in both the ingredients and amounts) and then generate treatments based on the prescriptions for that specific individual!\nSome existing research fields, such as causal inference and dynamic treatment regimes, get us close to this concept, but I don’t think we are anywhere near achieving it. My Ph.D. education has exposed me to both, and I’m excited to continue working on many stats/math projects until I can achieve my goal of tailoring prescriptions to individuals as described above!\nAnd about me outside of school: I don’t have any extra time besides connecting with my family abroad, occasional catch-ups with my friends, Sunday church, and watching Korean shows. Okay, that’s a pretty good list now that I look at it. Hahaha"
