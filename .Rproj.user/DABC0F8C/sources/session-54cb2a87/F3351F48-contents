# About Me

I’m a Ph.D. candidate in biostatistics at the University of Utah. I love turning complex data into clear stories—whether it’s Bayesian models or precision-medicine pipelines. When I’m not coding in R, you’ll find me binge-watching Korean variety shows (ask me for recs!).


# Research Interests

- **Precision Medicine**  
  Building models that tailor treatments at the individual level.
- **Causal Inference**
  Rather than the traditional associational study, I like doing things that can be more like "causal" in nature! 
- **Bayesian & MCMC**  
  From Gibbs samplers to RStan, I enjoy the math under the hood.
- **Dynamic Treatment Regimes**  
  Designing adaptive interventions that evolve over time.
