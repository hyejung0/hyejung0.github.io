## Research interests

My research spans **methodological biostatistics** and **applied clinical research**, with a focus on problems where study design and modeling choices materially affect clinical conclusions.

### Methodological interests
- **Causal inference** for observational data (e.g., inverse probability weighting; target trial thinking)  
- **Time-to-event modeling** and individualized decision rules (e.g., dynamic treatment regimes)  
- **Bayesian hierarchical modeling** for combining information across studies and endpoints  
- **Longitudinal + survival analyses**, including joint modeling of repeated measures and survival outcomes  

### Applied areas
- **Cancer outcomes research** (e.g., lung cancer, prostate cancer)  
- **Chronic disease** endpoints and surrogate outcomes (e.g., kidney disease)  
- **Real-world data** and electronic health records  

## Selected collaboration experience (examples)

- **Treatment timing and decision optimization in advanced NSCLC** using nationwide longitudinal EHR data  
- **Body composition and survival** in metastatic NSCLC using longitudinal imaging-derived measures  
- **Proteomics and prognosis** in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer using high-plex protein assays  
- **Ablation outcomes in atrial fibrillation** using clinical trial data and time-to-event methods  

## Reproducible workflows

I primarily work in **R**, with emphasis on reproducible pipelines, version control (Git/GitHub), and compute-aware workflows (parallel computing / HPC) when needed.
